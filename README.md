# Project-367
 3MW Solar PV Power Plant by Eaama Estates Private Limited, Vizianagaram

The project, Ground Mounted Solar Plant is located in Village Tentuvalasa, Tehsil Badangi, District
Vizianagaram, State Andhra Pradesh, Country India.
The project activity is a renewable power generation activity at Eaama Estates, Vizianagaram. The project
activity involves commissioning of 3MW Grid Connected Ground Mounted Solar Plant. The solar plant was
completed in single phase and put to use on 30/03/2016.

The purpose of the project activity is to utilize the solar energy source for clean electricity generation. The
net generated electricity from the project activity will be exported to the grid. The proposed project has been
synchronized with the national grid.

The project activity has been designed for electricity generation of about 6570MWh. In the absence of the
project activity an equivalent amount of electricity would have been generated from the connected/new
power plants in the integrated Indian grid system, which is predominantly based on fossil fuels. On the
contrary the operation of solar modules is emission free throughout the lifetime of the project activity. The
project activity doesnâ€™t involve any GHG emission sources.
